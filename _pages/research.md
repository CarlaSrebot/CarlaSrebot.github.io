      This paper examines the influence of managers from countries with different gender norms on workplace culture and gender disparities within organizations. Using data from a multinational firm operating in over 100 countries, we exploit cross-country manager rotations that are orthogonal to workers to estimate the impact of male managers’ gender norms on the work outcomes of male and female workers within the same team. Managers from countries with one standard deviation more progressive gender attitudes narrow the gender pay gap by 5 percentage points (18%), primarily by promoting women at higher rates. The effects persist beyond the manager’s rotation and are concentrated in countries with more conservative gender attitudes. Moreover, local managers in the destination office adjust their own behavior, becoming more gender-equal toward their subordinates. Overall, the evidence highlights the central role of individual managers in shaping corporate culture.

      This paper examines how firms and workers respond to a labor market flexibility shock in a setting characterized by high regulation costs. Focusing on the Brazilian labor market, I leverage linked formal employer–employee data to analyze the impacts of the 2017 Labor Reform, which removed constraints on flexible work schedules. I show that the reform increased job opportunities and employment, particularly in part-time positions, with larger gains for women. While the reform did not significantly affect unemployment rates at the state level, it reduced informality—which accounted for 40% of the workforce in 2016. Gender-specific analysis indicates that this decline in informality is primarily driven by women transitioning from informal to formal private-sector employment in the short run, followed by both women and men at the state level in the medium run. Overall, the findings highlight how labor market flexibility can reshape employment allocation when informality is a salient margin.

      This project studies how assimilation policies targeting American Indians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries affected individualism, ethnic identity, and attitudes towards the U.S. government, as measured through the clauses and language used in over 350 newly digitised tribal constitutions and charters. We first demonstrate that there is meaningful variation in the types of clauses (e.g., blood quantum or residence restrictions on membership) and language (e.g., emphasising the “tribe” or the “individual”) across constitutions. We then examine how tribal characteristics and historical exposure to government policies—such as Indian schools and land allotment—shaped constitutional features. Finally, we employ natural language processing techniques to assess how these characteristics affected trust and cooperation with the U.S. government during the Indian New Deal, measured by semantic similarity between constitutions written in the 1930s and a “model” constitution distributed by the Indian Office. Overall, the project highlights the long-run effects of assimilation policies on Indigenous institutional development, political culture, tribal sovereignty, collective identity, and intergovernmental relations.
